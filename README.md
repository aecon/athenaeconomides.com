# Astrofy | Personal Portfolio Website Template



## AE installtion process

### Step 0 - Install Node.js
* Go to https://nodejs.org
* Click the big LTS download button (it should auto-detect your OS)
* Run the installer, click through the defaults
* Close and reopen your terminal

Then verify:
```
node --version
npm --version
```

### Step 1 — Clone the Astrofy template
```
git clone https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy.git athenaeconomides.com
cd athenaeconomides.com
```

### Step 2 — Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Test it
```
npm run dev
```
You should see something like Local: http://localhost:4321/ — open that in your browser to see the default Astrofy template. Once you confirm it loads, you can move on to Step 3 (replacing the files with yours).

### Step 3 — Replace the files with yours
Extract the astrofy-migration.tar.gz I gave you. Then copy each file into the corresponding location in your new project:
```
# Config
cp astrofy-migration/src/config/config.ts src/config.ts

# Pages (replace existing + add new ones)
cp astrofy-migration/src/pages/index.astro src/pages/
cp astrofy-migration/src/pages/projects.astro src/pages/
cp cp astrofy-migration/src/pages/cv.astro src/pages/
cp astrofy-migration/src/pages/software.astro src/pages/
cp astrofy-migration/src/pages/services.astro src/pages/

# Components (replace existing)
cp astrofy-migration/src/components/SideBar.astro src/components/
cp astrofy-migration/src/components/SideBarMenu.astro src/components/
cp astrofy-migration/src/components/SideBarFooter.astro src/components/
```

### Step 4 — Add your images
```
# From your current website repo's graphics/ folder:
cp graphics/avg_all_groups_hr.jpg public/
cp graphics/Microglia_hr.jpg public/
cp graphics/rbc-sfs_hr.jpg public/
cp graphics/korali_hr.jpg public/

# From your img3D repo:
cp img3D/graphics/brains3D.jpg public/img3d_brains.jpg

# From your AggreQuant repo:
cp AggreQuant/graphics/pipeline.jpg public/aggrequant_pipeline.jpg
```

Preview locally
```
npm run dev
```

### Step 5 - Change my name
Edit my name inside `src/components/Header.astro`


### Step 6 - Change theme
To change the theme, edit line 21 in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. For example, to try the `corporate` theme:
```
<html lang="en" data-theme="corporate">
```
You can preview all themes visually at https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/ if you want to see them side by side before committing.



### Step 9 — Update the deploy config
Open astro.config.mjs and set your domain
```
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://athenaeconomides.com',
  integrations: [mdx(), sitemap(), tailwind()]
});
```

### Step 10 — Push to GitHub and deploy
Create a new repo (or repurpose your existing one):
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate to Astrofy"
git remote add origin https://github.com/aecon/athenaeconomides.com.git
git push -u origin main --force
```

For deployment, you have two options:
* Netlify (recommended, like the Astrofy demo uses): connect your GitHub repo at netlify.com, it auto-detects Astro and deploys.
* GitHub Pages: add a GitHub Actions workflow — Astro has a ready-made one in their docs, or you can add a .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

### Site config

You can change global site configuration on '/src/config.ts' file:

- **SITE_TITLE**: Default pages title.
- **SITE_DESCRIPTION**: Default pages title.
- **GENERATE_SLUG_FROM_TITLE**: By default Astrofy will generate the blog slug pages base on the article name. Set this var to false if you want to use the Astro file base (Compatible with Astrofy older versions).
- **TRANSITION_API**: Enable and disable transition API

### Components usage

#### Layout Components

The `BaseHead`, `Footer`, `Header`, and `SideBar` components are already included in the layout system. To change the website content you can edit the content of these components.

##### SideBar

In the Sidebar you can change your profilePicture, links to all your website pages, and your social icons.

You can change your avatar shape using [mask classes](https://daisyui.com/components/mask/).

The used social-icons are SVG form [BoxIcons](https://boxicons.com/) pack. You can replace the icons in the `SideBarFooter` component

To add a new page in the sidebar go to the `SideBarMenu` component.

```
<li><a class="py-3 text-base" id="home" href="/">Home</a></li>

```

**Note**: In order to change the sidebar menu's active item, you need to setup the prop `sideBarActiveItemID` in the `BaseLayout` component of your new page and add that id to the link in the `SideBarMenu`

#### TimeLine

The timeline components are used to confirm the CV.

```html
<div class="time-line-container">
  <TimeLineElement title="Element Title" subtitle="Subtitle">
    Content that can contain
    <div>divs</div>
    and <span>anything else you want</span>.
  </TimeLineElement>
  ...
</div>
```

#### Card & HorizontalCard

The cards are primarly used for the Project and the Blog components. They include a picture, a title, and a description. 

```html
<HorizontalCard title="Card Title" img="imge_url" desc="Description" url="Link
URL" target="Optional link target (_blank default)" badge="Optional badge"
tags={['Array','of','tags']} />
```

#### HorizontalCard Shop Item


This component is already included in the Store layout of the template. In case you want to use it in another place these are the props.

```html
<HorizontalShopItem
  title="Item Title"
  img="imge_url"
  desc="Item description"
  pricing="current_price"
  oldPricing="old_price"
  checkoutUrl="external store checkout url"
  badge="Optional badge"
  url="item details url"
  custom_link="Custom link url"
  custom_link_label="Cutom link btn label"
  target="Optional link target (_self default)"
/>
```

#### Adding a Custom Component

To add a custom component, you can create a .astro file in the components folder under the source folder. 

Components must follow this template. The ```---``` represents the code fence and uses Javascript and can be used for imports. 

The HTML component is the actual style of your new component. 

```html
---
// Component Script (JavaScript)
---
<!-- Component Template (HTML + JS Expressions) -->
```

For more details, see the [astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) documentation here. 

### Layouts

Include `BaseLayout` in each page you add and `PostLayout` to your post pages.

The BaseLayout defines a general template for each new webpage you want to add. It imports constants SITE_TITLE and SITE_DESCRIPTION which can be modified in the ```../config``` folder. Data placed there can be imported anywhere using import. 

### Content

You can add a [content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) in `/content/' folder, you will need add it at config.ts.

#### config.ts

Where you need to define your content collections, we define our content schemas too.

#### Blog

Add your `md` blog post in the `/content/blog/` folder.

##### Post format

Add code with this format in the top of each post file.

```
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Description"
pubDate: "Post date format(Sep 10 2022)"
heroImage: "Post Hero Image URL"
---
```

### Pages

#### Blog

Blog uses Astro's content collection to query post's `md`.

##### [page].astro

The `[page].astro` is the route to work with the paginated post list. You can change there the number of items listed for each page and the pagination button labels.

##### [slug].astro

The `[slug].astro` is the base route for every blog post, you can customize the page layout or behaviour, by default uses `content/blog` for content collection and `PostLayout` as layout.

#### Shop

Add your `md` item in the `/pages/shop/` folder.

##### [page].astro

The `[page].astro` is the route to work with the paginated item list. You can change there the number of items listed for each page and the pagination button labels. The shop will render all `.md` files you include inside this folder.

##### Item format

Add code with this format at the top of each item file.

```js
---
title: "Demo Item 1"
description: "Item description"
heroImage: "Item img url"
details: true // show or hide details btn
custom_link_label: "Custom btn link label"
custom_link: "Custom btn link"
pubDate: "Sep 15 2022"
pricing: "$15"
oldPricing: "$25.5"
badge: "Featured"
checkoutUrl: "https://checkouturl.com/"
---
```

#### Static pages

The other pages included in the template are static pages. The `index` page belongs to the root page. You can add your pages directly in the `/pages` folder and then add a link to those pages in the `sidebar` component.

Feel free to modify the content included in the pages that the template contains or add the ones you need.

### Theming

To change the template theme change the `data-theme` attribute of the `<html>` tag in `BaseLayout.astro` file.

You can choose among 30 themes available or create your custom theme. See themes available [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

## Sitemap

The Sitemap is generated automatically when you build your website in the root of the domain. Please update the `robots.txt` file in the public folder with your site name URL for the Sitemap.

## Deploy

You can deploy your site on your favourite static hosting service such as Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

The configuration for the deployment varies depending on the platform where you are going to do it. See the [official Astro information](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy your website.

> **⚠️ CAUTION** </br>
> The Blog pagination of this template is implemented using dynamic route parameters in its filename and for now this format is incompatible with SSR deploy configs, so please use the default static deploy options for your deployments.
