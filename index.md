# Hi, I'm Athena!
**Postdoc**  •  **Computational Engineer**


## Education

* Ph.D., Computational Science and Engineering, D-MAVT, ETH Zürich, 2020
* M.Sc., Mechanical Engineering, University of Cyprus, 2015
* B.Sc., Mechanical Engineering, University of Cyprus, 2013


## Research Interests

* Image Processing
* Computational microfluidics & Blood flow simulations
* Bayesian inference & Uncertainty Quantification


## Selected Projects

During my Joint post-doc at the labs of Prof. Petros Koumoutsakos (ETH Zurich) and Prof. Adriano Aguzzi (University of Zurich), I developed computational pipelines to process large, volumetric image data obtained via light-sheet microscopy. See below for selected projects!


### Segmentation of neuronal cells in whole mouse brains
<img style="float: left;" src="graphics/avg_all_groups_360x140.jpg" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">
An international collaboration aiming to develop a new protein-based delivery system to the central nervous system of the brain. 3D images of whole mouse-brain scans were used to detect the bio-distribution of the delivery system, using light-sheet microscopy.
Image processing was performed using a custom, in-house developed pipeline, employing shared-memory parallelism, targeted for fast processing of large 3D image datasets. Publication currently under review in Cell.

### Segmentation of microglia cells in drug efficacy studies
<img align="right" src="graphics/Microglia_322x190.jpg" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"/>
A study for the efficacy of different drugs in neurodegenerative diseases.
A novel image processing pipeline was developed to quantify drug efficacy on the sub-cellular level, through object segmentation of stained neural cells in 3D whole mouse-brain scans.
Publication under preparation.
