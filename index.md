## Selected Projects

During my Joint post-doc at the labs of Prof. Petros Koumoutsakos (ETH Zurich) and Prof. Adriano Aguzzi (University of Zurich), I developed computational pipelines to process large, volumetric image data obtained via light-sheet microscopy. See below for selected projects!


### Segmentation of neuronal cells in whole mouse brains
<IMG SRC="graphics/avg_all_groups_320x190.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10"/>
An international collaboration aiming to develop a new protein-based delivery system to the central nervous system of the brain. 3D images of whole mouse-brain scans were used to detect the bio-distribution of the delivery system, using light-sheet microscopy.
Image processing was performed using a custom, in-house developed pipeline, employing shared-memory parallelism, targeted for fast processing of large 3D image datasets. Publication currently under review in Cell.

### Segmentation of microglia cells in drug efficacy studies
<IMG SRC="graphics/Microglia_320x190.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10"/>
A study for the efficacy of different drugs in neurodegenerative diseases.
A novel image processing pipeline was developed to quantify drug efficacy on the sub-cellular level, through object segmentation of stained neural cells in 3D whole mouse-brain scans.
Publication under preparation.

### Quantification of the stress-free state of human red blood cells
<IMG SRC="graphics/rbc-sfs_320x190.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10"/>
Human erythrocytes are the dominant constituents of blood and their dynamics is governed by the visco-elastic properties of their membrane. Despite its importance, today’s RBC membrane models are not able to predict blood flows without case specific adjustment of their parameters. Existing RBC models rely on the assumption of a stress-free state (SFS) of the cytoskeleton. This state is arbitrarily selected while current experimental methods cannot measure it directly. Essentially RBC models are not transferable and their parameters are adapted arbitrarily across flow configurations (see Table 1 in Economides et al. [1]). Here, we introduce a transferable RBC model (t-RBC) parameterized by the SFS and the visco-elastic properties of the membrane. The model is calibrated from single-cell experiments using Bayesian inference. The t-RBC model is tested on several flow configurations and is shown to reproduce a wide range of experimental data without further calibration of its parameters. We believe that the model introduced in this study opens new frontiers for high fidelity predictions of blood flows.
